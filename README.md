## ðŸŽ® Body Track VR â€“ EMG Biofeedback in Virtual Reality. Final degree project.

**Body Track VR** is an interactive VR application that visualizes EMG (electromyographic) activity on a customizable 3D avatar. Users can select specific muscles and receive real-time biofeedback via color-coded overlays based on EMG intensity.

ðŸ§  Developed in **Unity**, using **C#**, **MATLAB**, and integrated with the **Ultium EMG system (Noraxon)**.  
ðŸŽ“ Final Degree Project (TFG) â€“ **Biomedical Engineering**, University of Alicante (Grade: 9.5/10).
